k-OC stands for k-OutDated Checker. k-OC scans automatically, twice a day, all your installed plugins against the WordPress Plugin Directory for outdated plugins and email an alert for immediate update.

**History**

k-OC got its start when I had to maintain a lot of WordPress installations which their owners didn't care much about maintenance and security.

After downloading and extracting the latest version of k-OC:

1. Upload the folder `k-outdated-plugin-checker-k-opc` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.

3. That's all!
